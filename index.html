            Dr. A. P. J. Abdul Kalam was one of the most admired scientists and leaders of India.
            He played a vital role in India’s space and missile development programs and inspired
            millions of students with his vision and humility.

        <p>
            What I admire most about him is his simplicity, dedication to education, and love for
            the youth of the nation. Despite achieving great success, he remained grounded and
            always encouraged young minds to dream big.
        </p>

        <p>
            His life teaches us that with hard work, discipline, and honesty, anyone can rise from
            humble beginnings to achieve greatness.
